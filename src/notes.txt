Notes take during lecture that may help:

1) every view will have its own MovieController and each controller will implement Observer interface and call update() method.

2) The model Movie.java will inherit abstract parent Observer class and when a change occurs it will call setChange() method

Ex:
Producer- inherits parent abstract class and when a change occurs it calls setChange()

Consumer- implements Observer interface and listens for changes, when a change occurs it calls update() method.
